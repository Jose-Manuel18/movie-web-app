This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project i've built using Next.js, [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), and [TMDB (The Movie Database)](https://www.themoviedb.org/), which is designed to help you discover new movies and TV shows to watch. Next.js is a modern web framework that allows for server-side rendering, which means that the application can load quickly and efficiently. Framer Motion is a library that allows for beautiful animations and transitions, making the application visually appealing. Finally, TMDB is a database of movies and TV shows that provides all the necessary information to display the latest movies and TV shows. The movie application is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs), a cloud platform for deploying web applications. Vercel provides a seamless integration with Next.js and allows for fast deployment of the application. This means that you'll always have access to the latest version of the application, and it will load quickly and efficiently.
